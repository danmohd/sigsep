>  MLSP Fall 2020 Project Repo for Team 5: "Music Source Separation Using Overcomplete Dictionary Representations of Audio Waveforms"

## Abstract:
We use supervised learning techniques to form custom bases for different music components (ex.  Vocals,Drums, Bass), which can be used to segregate the different sources from a mixed waveform. We explore someclassical techniques used in audio source separation, such as K-singular value decomposition (K-SVD) andnon-negative matrix factorization (NMF). To correctly handle phase information, a cyclic dictionary learningbased approach is taken to represent the time domain waveform, rather than a time-frequency representation.This attempts to implicitly encode phase information so that the linear mixer model is always valid. Our goalis to study a waveform based representation to validate if it is useful for music source separation.

## Contributions:
Mohammed Danish is the author of the code and all the team members worked collaboratively to write the code and tune the parameters.
